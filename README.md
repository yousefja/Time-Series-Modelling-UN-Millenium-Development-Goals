# Time-Series-Modelling-UN-Millenium-Development-Goals
 Using ML techniques to forecast UN MDGs  

This is an ongoing project. I seek to uncover the best predictors of a nation's development through correlation analysis and multivariate time series
modelling using python and Tensorflow. The hope is that finding which macroeconomic indicators are the best predictors could theoretically provide
insight to the UN and specific nations about which obstacles they need to overcome to progress economically, technologically, and for the overall 
well-being of their populations. 

In this project, some techniques I use include:

 Data Wrangling using Pandas
 
 Initial Feature Selection using Pearson Correlation 
 
 Data Normalization/Standardization 
 
 Multivariate Data Imputation using K Nearest Neighbor Imputation, Iterative Imputation and Linear Time Interpolation
 
 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting using 1D CNNs, RNNs (LSTMs), and ARIMA
 
 Predictive modelling using Regression Analysis (KNeighbors, Linear, Logistic) Decision Trees/Random Forests
